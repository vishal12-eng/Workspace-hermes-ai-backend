"""Hermes-tools-as-MCP server for the codex_app_server runtime.

When the user runs `openai/*` turns through the codex app-server, codex
owns the loop and builds its own tool list. By default, that means
Hermes' richer tool surface — web search, browser automation,
delegate_task subagents, vision analysis, persistent memory, skills,
cross-session search, image generation, TTS — is unreachable.

This module exposes a curated subset of those Hermes tools to the
spawned codex subprocess via stdio MCP. Codex registers it as a normal
MCP server (per `~/.codex/config.toml [mcp_servers.hermes-tools]`) and
the user gets full Hermes capability inside a Codex turn.

Scope (what we expose):
  - web_search, web_extract              — Firecrawl, no codex equivalent
  - browser_navigate / _click / _type /  — Camofox/Browserbase automation
    _snapshot / _scroll / _back / _press /
    _get_images / _console / _vision
  - vision_analyze                       — image inspection by vision model
  - image_generate                       — image generation
  - skill_view, skills_list              — Hermes' skill library
  - text_to_speech                       — TTS
  - kanban_* (complete/block/comment/    — kanban worker + orchestrator
    heartbeat/show/list/create/            handoff (stateless: read env var,
    unblock/link)                          write ~/.hermes/kanban.db)

What we DO NOT expose:
  - terminal / shell                     — codex's own shell tool
  - read_file / write_file / patch       — codex's apply_patch + shell
  - search_files / process               — codex's shell
  - clarify                              — codex's own UX
  - delegate_task / todo                 — `_AGENT_LOOP_TOOLS` in Hermes
                                           (model_tools.py). They require
                                           the running AIAgent context to
                                           dispatch (mid-loop state), so a
                                           stateless MCP callback can't
                                           drive them. See the inline
                                           comment on EXPOSED_TOOLS below.

Exposed via STATELESS SHIMS (#26604) rather than the generic dispatcher:
  - memory                               — tools.memory_tool.load_on_disk_store()
                                           per call: native caps, drift guard,
                                           threat scan, locking all inherited
  - session_search                       — read-only SessionDB over the state
                                           DB; the calling session's id rides
                                           the canonical HERMES_SESSION_ID
  The `_AGENT_LOOP_TOOLS` refusal in handle_function_call stays intact for
  every other caller — the shims are dedicated closures, not a widened gate.

Run with: python -m agent.transports.hermes_tools_mcp_server
Spawned by: CodexAppServerSession.ensure_started() when the runtime is
            active and config opts in.

# --- Stateless agent-loop shims (#26604) ---------------------------------
#
# `memory` and `session_search` are `_AGENT_LOOP_TOOLS`: the generic
# dispatcher refuses them because natively they receive live agent state
# (the loop's MemoryStore / session-DB handle) from tool_executor. Both have
# workable stateless equivalents, so a runtime that owns its own agent loop
# (codex app-server) can regain them through this server without touching
# that refusal:
#
#   memory         → a fresh `load_on_disk_store()` per call. Char caps,
#                    config overrides, external-drift guard, threat scan and
#                    file locking live in MemoryStore/memory_tool and are
#                    inherited. The consolidation-failure breaker is NOT:
#                    a fresh store per call resets its counter every time, so
#                    it can never trip here (it is reset natively at the turn
#                    boundary, and this subprocess has no turns).
#                    NOTE: a shim write cannot mirror through MemoryProvider
#                    hooks (no MemoryManager in this subprocess), so when
#                    `memory.provider` configures an external backend the
#                    shim FAILS CLOSED — unregistered, and refused at
#                    dispatch — rather than silently diverging the stores.
#                    NOTE: with no foreground approver in a stdio subprocess
#                    the native write-approval gate can return `staged`; the
#                    call reports success and the write does not land yet.
#   session_search → `SessionDB(read_only=True)` over the state DB (never a
#                    writable handle in a model-facing subprocess). NOT a
#                    faithful equivalent: it adds a deterministic zero-hit
#                    OR-relaxation the native tool does not have (below).
#                    The calling session's id arrives via the canonical
#                    HERMES_SESSION_ID (see `_SESSION_ID_ENV`); when that is
#                    unset, own-lineage exclusion is simply INACTIVE —
#                    fail-open, results just include the caller, no error.
#                    The DB path can be pointed elsewhere with
#                    HERMES_MCP_STATE_DB (defaults to the profile's
#                    state.db) — an internal mechanism bridge, not a
#                    user-facing setting.

# The CANONICAL session-context variable — deliberately not a shim-specific name.
# `set_current_session_id()` writes it (gateway/session_context.py), `_VAR_MAP` carries
# it, and `_inject_session_context_env()` inside `hermes_subprocess_env()` bridges it
# into the HOST process's spawn env. That is hop 1 only: codex builds an MCP child's
# env from a fixed whitelist plus the names listed in the entry's `env_vars` (a
# spawn-time snapshot of the codex process env). The migration entry names
# HERMES_SESSION_ID there (`_build_hermes_tools_mcp_entry`), so under codex the shim
# receives the ACTIVE session's id and own-lineage exclusion is ACTIVE; a host that
# delivers nothing leaves it INACTIVE (fail-open, documented above). Any other host
# delivers it the same two ways: name it in the entry's `env_vars` or set it in the
# server's spawn env directly. Reading a
# bespoke name instead would be strictly worse: it has no producer in any launch path,
# and the cross-session leak guard in `_inject_session_context_env` covers only
# `_VAR_MAP` keys, so a bespoke var could carry a SIBLING session's id under a
# concurrent host and exclude the wrong lineage.
